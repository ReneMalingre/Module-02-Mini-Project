# Module 02 Mini Project – CSS Snippet Cheatsheet

This project is a webpage that contains a collection of CSS snippets. This aim of the project is to build up a knowledge-base of CSS that is easily accessible to the user. The goal is to create a responsive and visually appealing layout that showcases labeled CSS snippets in a grid format.

## Project Requirements

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

- As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.
- As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.
- As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.
- As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

## Specifications

The following specifications must be met:

- Use semantic HTML elements and proper indentation.
- Use CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme.
- Use flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.
- Each CSS snippet should have a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in an HTML `pre` element.
- Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click using the CSS `user-select` property.
- Incorporate a background color using a CSS `linear-gradient` function.
- Incorporate a bit of animation using the CSS `transition` property.
- The app needs to be responsive, responding to screen-size changes to maintain readability in an attractive layout.

## Usage

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The application will display a grid of labeled CSS snippets. Click on any snippet to highlight it for copying. The application is designed to be responsive, so it will adjust to different screen sizes for optimal readability.
